			There’s a small labyrinth at school, near the Windhover Contemplation Center that I visit sometimes.

			I like to visit in the afternoons; often as the day is winding down.
		</br></br>
		In this labyrinth, I find, in walking, and circling, always going forward, never back, in returning to almost the same place but never quite the same place.
	</br></br>
	In this labyrinth, I find, with effort, finer frequencies of feeling. 
</br></br>
How this happens: I never look up during the time that I am traveling. I see my focus; I am looking down at my feet, the steps I'm making, measuring the width of the blue lines demarcating walls against the gray spaces where my feet are traveling.
</br></br>
Then, I begin to hear my focus. It leaves my eyes at my feet and begins to wander, registering up the sounds around me, rustling leaves, birdsong, cars on the street along the road, and also, the sounds I'm making, the rustle of my feet taking steps, shuffling along the gravel and crunching on little tiny rocks as I make my way forward.
</p>
</div>


<div class="project-prompt project-margins">
	<p class="text-project-prompt">
		Then, I begin to feel my focus.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="statement-box">
</div>


	<div class="project-content section-container">
		<p class="text-project">
			Then I feel my focus; I feel the shift come as I'm taking a slight misstep, or round a corner of a labyrinth too wide, enough to miss the line, or as the afternoon breeze picks up and, feeling the evenness or unevenness of my own breath. How had I not felt before the parched raggedness of my own breathing?
		</br></br>
		IAnd so it goes, my attentions, seeing, hearing, feeling,  unspooling. And so I go, no where, but forward, not straight, nor still, I wind and unwind. 
	</br></br>
At times, there are other people. I snap back, and wonder who these people are, or how close they are, if they're ahead or behind of me. Are they closer or farther to that end? Will we meet? I am, all of a sudden taut. </br></br>
So it takes work, to unspool again. 
</br></br>
If am trying, the end will come abruptly, and surprise! 
my feet are forced to a stop.
</br></br>
At this time, I'll look up and can swear, 
</br></br>
that the world is more colorful,
</br></br>
the sound of air more palpable,
</br></br>
more crisp on my skin now, 
</br></br>
than when I first fixed eyes on my feet and started to move.
