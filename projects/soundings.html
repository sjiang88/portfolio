			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>
				Medicine X is a non-traditional conference with a mission: To recognize all stakeholders for their expertise in health care, and give traditionally underheard voices&mdash;patients and caregivers&mdash;the opportunity to lead the conversation about the future of health care.
			</p>
		</div>
		<p class="emphasis-statement emphasis-vertical-blank">
			As a designer, I wondered whether we could develop a conference experience that reflected this mission and game-changing philosophy.

			<div class="project-header-description">
				<p class="text-project">
					Inspired by other examples of open-ended participatory walls as well as the old-school community bulletin board, we developed a set of cards each containing one of three open-ended prompts to the community.

				Ask cards were open-ended for personalization and interpretation.	
			</p>
			<p class="concept-descriptions-item">
				Attendees were given personalized stickers to contribute to another’s card, and serve as a reachout point for later
			</p>
			<p class="concept-descriptions-item">
				We hoped that users would use the opportunity to mark moments from the conference.

				<p class="text-project">
					The cards were place on a “sounding wall”, a simple construction of ribbon and clips in a very widely trafficked area of the conference. The installation remained for all days of the conference where attendees were invited to take a moment to pause, reflect and contribute to the wall. We collected the cards and digitized a selection for record-keeping.
