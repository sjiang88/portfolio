      The summer after my sophomore year at Stanford University, my mother became very seriously, and very suddenly ill.
    </p>
  </div>

    <p class="text-project">
      In a relatively short span of time,  she stopped being able to sleep, had a series of severe panic attacks,
      and finally, had to admit herself into psychiatric care. I returned home to become her full-time caregiver
      and together, we began to navigate a new normal.
      </br></br>
      This new normal involved a seemingly endless combination of medications,
      tangling with insurance and disability leave, and the day to day management of her anxiety.
      </br></br>
      We also had to find a different way to communicate; she could not verbalize her experience and needs.
      Sometimes, after a particularly bad night, she might only be able to speak in a stuttering whisper,
      and her sentences would trail off. In my mom’s own words, “depression took her confidence”.
      A first-generation immigrant from China, my mother had spent nearly two decades living in English-speaking countries,
      learning how to express herself and be understood in her non-native tongue.
      </br></br>
      Losing her voice in this way must have been devastating.

      For me: How to understand what she wanted and  needed? How to communicate those needs to her providers?
      How to help to pick up the pieces?

      In his essay,  writer Andrew Solomon wrote, “I did not experience depression until I had pretty much solved my problems...
      It was when life was finally in order that depression came slinking in and spoiled everything.”
      </br></br>
      For mom too, depression and anxiety came at an unexpected time. By this time, she was running several miles every day,
      had just marked the year anniversary of working at a new job, and had singehandedly moved herself and my younger sister
      into a new house in the  quiet tree-lined suburb out on the Main Line, outside of Philadelphia. It couldn’t have been a worse time.
      </br></br>
      That summer, she would tell me often how ashamed she felt, how much of a burden she was on me, how she’d failed our family.
