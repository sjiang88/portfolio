      The summer after my sophomore year at Stanford University, my mother became very seriously, and very suddenly ill.

      In a relatively short span of time,  she stopped being able to sleep, had a series of severe panic attacks, and finally, had to admit herself into psychiatric care. I returned home to become her full-time caregiver and together, we began to navigate a new normal. 
    </br></br>
    This new normal involved a seemingly endless combination of medications, tangling with insurance and disability leave, and the day to day management of her anxiety. 
  </br></br>
  We also had to find a different way to communicate; the nights of poor sleep had left mom unable to verbalize her experience and needs. Sometimes, after a particularly bad night, she might only be able to speak in a stuttering whisper. Her sentences would trail off, or she’d become confused mid-thought and lose her way. In my mom’s own words, “depression took my confidence”.  A first-generation immigrant from China, she had spent nearly two decades living in Australia and the United States, learning how to express herself and be understood in her non-native tongue. 
</br></br>
Losing her voice in this way must have been devastating.

    For me as her caregiver, there was the daily challenge of medication and anxiety management. I helped to tussle with disability and deciphered insurance bills. But when my mom lost her voice, I had to face still deeper questions: 
  </br></br>
  How to understand what mom really wanted and needed? How to communicate those needs to her providers? How to fill the gaps in her care that simply couldn’t be addressed by the medical system.
</br></br>
One of the biggest gaps in her care centered around her Chinese identity, and the question of shame.

    In his essay,  writer Andrew Solomon wrote, “I did not experience depression until I had pretty much solved my problems...
    It was when life was finally in order that depression came slinking in and spoiled everything.”
  </br></br>
  For mom too, depression and anxiety came at an unexpected time. By this time, she was running several miles every day, had just marked the year anniversary of working at a new job, and had singehandedly moved herself and my younger sister into a new house in a quiet tree-lined suburb in the outskirts of Philadelphia. It couldn’t have been a more unexpected time. 
</br></br>
Unlike Andrew Solomon, my mother is a Chinese-American immigrant. Mom felt she couldn't tell anyone about her illness, least of all our family back in China. To them, she was a pillar of strength. They couldn't see her like this. We lacked a shared vocabulary for mental illness, I saw mental illness as a disease, Mom saw it as a failure of nerve. 
</br></br>
That summer, she would tell me often how ashamed she felt, how much of a burden she was, how she’d failed our family.

  I grew an outer shell. As if to will away her negative thinking, I became irresolutely positive in outlook. To keep us from the mire of rumination, I structured our days. I became implacable, positive, reassuring. I urged her to keep on trying medication scheme after medication scheme, downloaded meditation apps, searched for Chinese-language therapy (the nearest counselor was an hour-and a half drive), massaged her temples when she had terrible headaches, reviewed her CBT journals, and talked her through her anxiety each day. 
</br></br>
Only at nights would my conviction loosen and the shell unfasten. After seeing her to sleep, I would tiptoe down the hall of my house, taking care not to let the floorboards sqeak. Then in the darkness and the quiet of my room, I would let my own fears have time. 
</br></br>
What if mom was right and her medication was making her sick, not better? Would she ever be able to 
</br></br>
Mom slowly began to recover. 
</br></br>
When I came back to school, I felt I needed to speak about the experience we were having together, and to open up the window somewhat to the experience of caring for a loved one with mental illness. With the help of mentors at the Stanford Storytelling Project, and with her permission, I interviewed my mother on this difficult subject. Together we recounted some of the most difficult parts of what we had gone through together. 
</br></br>
There are so many moments that did not make it into the final cut of this piece. This is an ongoing story.
