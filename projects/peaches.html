						<p>
							First-time parenting experiences are fraught with uncertainty and stress. In China, where there's a lack of established trusted parenting practices, and a generational rejection of traditional ways, new parents go elsewhere to find the answers, guidance and support they need. 

						</p>
					</div>

					<p id="white" class="emphasis-statement emphasis-vertical-blank">
						Our team of designers and engineers from Stanford U, Peking U. and Tsinghua U. wanted to know if there was a way to leverage technology to improve the first-time parenting experience and assist parents in improving early developmental outcomes for their children.

						<h2 class="emphasis-title">In the field</h2>
						<p>
							Equipped with a set of questions and some initial intuitions about the experiences of first-time parents in Beijing, we went out to conduct exploratory interviews with users. 

						</p>
					</div>

					<p class="emphasis-statement emphasis-vertical-blank">
						We interviewed 6 young parents between ages 20-40, two fathers and 4 mothers. All were first time parents and had children between 5-mo (newborn) and 6 years old (starting kindergarten). 2 of our interviewees were from second-tier cities visiting Beijing with their families, and the others were residents of Beijing. 4-6 of our parents had college education. Interviews were either sit-down (arranged) or man-on-the-street style interviews.

						</br>

						<div class="tooltip-text">
							Man on the street style interviews have upsides and some serious drawbacks. Upside: Mothers we interviewed in the field were with their children in a naturalistic way - playing or walking alongside, giving us great context for observation. Drawback: Not having the full attention of our parents walking on the street. Unlike in the US cultures, it's not common at all for a person to be stopped on the street and asked for their opinion in China. This made some of our "asks" uncomfortable.

						<p>
							We started our design work by asking parents how they document their child’s health and what specific concerns they had around health and development. We ended up learning more about informal documentation - memory-making and the gap between intention and action that almost all our parents referenced. We used these findings to craft some guiding questions.

					<div class="research-wrapper">
						<div class="flex-container col3">

						<h2 class="emphasis-title">Concept</h2>
						<p>
							Could the informal record of a child’s life (those photos, videos and cherished moments) be combined with a system aimed at closing gap between intention and action for busy working parents? We envisioned a mobile app that parents could use to create a simple, highly visual living document that chronicled their child's progression, paired with a way to log health and development outcomes through the form of milestones. With that concept in mind, we started prototyping.
