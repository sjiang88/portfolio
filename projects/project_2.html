				<h2>Problem one</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="project-header-description insight-statement-description">
				<p class="text-project white">
					Academic medical conferences are known for being exclusive to medical professionals and industry leaders.  One-third of the Med X audience is patient or caregiver. They are leaders and experts - but at an academic medical conference, they may not feel that way. 
				</p></br>
				<p class="insight-statement-emphasis white">
					How might we place <span id="yellow">inclusivity</span> at the center of the conference experience?

			<div class="insight-statement-title white">
				<h2>Problem two</h2>
			</div>

			<div class="project-header-description insight-statement-description">
				<p class="text-project white">
					The conference encourages participants to look for their “next big idea” or next collaborators in unexpected places. But it can be difficult to find those people amidst the hectic schedule and numerous activities and sessions in parallel. 
				</p></br>
				<p class="insight-statement-emphasis">
					How might we lessen the feeling of “missing out” and increase the number of <span id="yellow">“aha!” connections</span>?

			<h2>Problem three</h2>
		</div>

		<div class="project-header-description insight-statement-description">
			<p class="text-project white">
				With increasingly more connections being made virtually, transient physical gatherings like conferences lend a special urgency to everyone participating. For organizers, the the days of the conference are themselves stories, with unique highlights and milestones.  
			</p></br>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="project-header-description">
			<p class="text-project">
				Community prompt card-based soundings wall that encourages interactive discussion, sharing and connection. Each card contains one of three open-ended prompts that attendees could fill out.

			<div class="back">
				<p class="back-text">
					Attendees were given stickers with their twitter handles to add to their own cards or to others’ cards. Viewers could see others interested in similar topics, and could connect directly via social media.

			<div class="front">
				<img src="../img/2_3.png" alt="blue offering card example">
			</div>
			<div class="back">
				<p class="back-text">
					The installation surfaced expertise and interest in  under-represented topics in academic medicine that was helpful to the conference organizers. Transgender health was a topic at the subsequent conference in April 2017.

					Cardwriters did not take the exercise too seriously. Which we loved! Others used the cards as a way to invite others to connect after conference hours for meals and drinks.

			<p class="text-project">
				Did the project provide an alternative means of engagement for attendees? Yes. We found that our experiment&mdash;aimed at preserve the sense of spontaneity and discovery in the in-person human gathering &mdash;was well subscribed, even for our incredibly plugged-in and social-media-savvy attendees.

			<p class="text-project">
				What was the impact of the wall? Hard to say. We may not be able to measure all the new collaborations, projects or ideas our soundings wall sparked. However, we’re excited to see members of the Med X taking the concept of participatory physical discussion into their own communities.

				For a further iteration, I would love to take the collected cards and digitize them and make them searchable online. It might be an interesting way to give the soundings wall a life after the conference.
